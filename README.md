# PigPatrolBeaglebone

Java and JNA interface to read floats sent via I2C line from an Arduino.

The JNA C files must be compiled on the Beaglebone and moved to the same dirrectory as where the JAR file is
being launched from.

The Arduino code used in conjunction with this code can be found [here](https://github.com/gdeshazer/Arduino-Capacitive-Sensor/tree/master).
